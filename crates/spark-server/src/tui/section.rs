//! [`Section`] — the sidebar's navigation model, and the SSOT three things read.
//!
//! The sidebar draws rows from it, Tab steps through those rows, and the mouse
//! handler maps a clicked row back to a section. Those three used to carry
//! their own hardcoded copies of the order and the subsection labels, which is
//! exactly how Tab came to skip past rows the sidebar was drawing. Adding a
//! section means editing this file and nothing else.
