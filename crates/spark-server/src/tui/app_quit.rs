//! What `q` costs, and when it costs a second press.
//!
//! Split from `app.rs` at the 500-LoC cap, and a coherent unit on its own:
//! these three functions are the whole of the guard, and the one thing worth
//! keeping in view together is that `q` is not "close the window".
//!
//! ★ **`q` DRAINS AND STOPS THE SERVER**, exactly like Ctrl+C — it sets
//! `should_quit`, the event loop breaks, and the loop then calls
//! `shutdown::request`. It was bound globally, on every screen, with no
//! confirmation, so one stray keypress while reading logs ended a four-hour
//! benchmark with no way back. The key map already said so honestly; saying so
//! is not the same as not doing it.
//!
//! The confirmation is deliberately conditional. A prompt on an idle dashboard
//! costs a keystroke and protects nothing, and a prompt that is usually
//! pointless is one the user learns to dismiss without reading — which is
//! precisely the reflex that would carry them through the one that mattered.
