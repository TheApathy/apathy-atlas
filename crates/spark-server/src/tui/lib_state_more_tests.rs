//! A second test file for `lib_state` rather than a first for `lib_keys`,
//! because these reach private state — and because the claims they pin are
//! claims the UI makes about ITSELF. A refusal that says "press Esc, then d"
//! is an assertion about navigation, and it was wrong when first written: the
//! config pane escapes to Cards, not to the list, and `d` did nothing there.
//! The advice and the key map live in different files, so nothing but a test
