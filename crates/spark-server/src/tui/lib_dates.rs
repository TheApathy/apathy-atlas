//! When a recipe was last updated, and where that answer comes from.
//!
//! Two sources, in order. `metadata.updated` in the recipe file is
//! authoritative — it is what the author wrote. For a recipe that carries none,
//! which today is all of them, GitHub's commit history for that file is the
//! fallback.
//!
//! ## Why the fallback is lazy
//!
//! Dating a recipe costs one `api.github.com` call, and that API allows **60
//! per hour unauthenticated**. Dating the whole index would spend 25 of them
//! per refresh, so two refreshes would exhaust the budget the Library itself
//! depends on. So exactly one recipe is dated at a time, only the one whose
//! details are on screen, only if it has no date of its own, and only once per
//! session — including when the lookup fails, so an offline box does not spend
//! a thread per frame rediscovering that it is offline.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! The same contract as `recipe::fetch`, which this calls into: the render
//! thread never polls a future, only `try_recv`s. The work happens on a plain
//! `std::thread`.
